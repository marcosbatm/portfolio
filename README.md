# HTML & CSS Portfolio

This is a pretty simple personal portfolio done with HTML, CSS (+ a bit of Bootstrap) when learning and practicing theri foundations.

The goal wasn't for it to look beatifull neither to have the best design and reactiveness, but to be web-responsive and display some information about me.
